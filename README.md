# HR Analytics Case Study in Power BI

This repository contains my completed project from the [Case Study: HR Analytics in Power BI] course on DataCamp.

## üìä Project Overview

In this case study, I worked with HR data from a fictional software company, **Atlas Labs**, to explore key patterns and visual insights related to employee attrition.

The goal of the project was to:
- Import, clean, and transform HR data in Power BI
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create interactive, insightful visualizations using DAX
- Analyze employee attrition and identify influencing factors
- Apply final design touches for a clean and branded dashboard look

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Skills Practiced

- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (data transformation)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## üí° What I Learned

Throughout this case study, I strengthened my Power BI skills by:
- Practicing data modeling and using relationships between tables
- Creating calculated columns and measures with DAX

- Interpreting data to provide actionable insights on HR attrition

This was a great hands-on project to apply real-world Power BI techniques in a business context.
